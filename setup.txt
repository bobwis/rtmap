Actually you need to install plotly.js-dist via npm instead of plotly.js,
See this : #150 (comment)
and you can find more on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54200157/should-i-install-plotly-js-or-plotly-js-dist-via-npm

npm uninstall plotly.js
npm install plotly.js-dist angular-plotly.js
npm install -D @types/plotly.js

then go to node_modules/@types and rename the plotly.js folder to plotly.js-dist

in app-module.ts

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import * as PlotlyJS from 'plotly.js-dist';
import { PlotlyModule } from 'angular-plotly.js';

PlotlyModule.plotlyjs = PlotlyJS;

@NgModule({
    imports: [CommonModule, PlotlyModule],
    ...
})
export class AppModule { }

and it should works

For anyone else coming along, the solution by @CorentinMAG works, but instead of renaming the directory, you should install it as an alias. that way you will have consistent environments wherever you need them

ng add @types/plotly.js-dist@npm:@types/plotly.js
